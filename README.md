# Integrated Veterinary Application for Cow Health Management

## Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a **Comprehensive Veterinary Application** designed to enhance cow health management through advanced technologies. The application aims to improve disease detection, cow care practices, milk production prediction, and veterinary communication. By leveraging machine learning, image processing, and real-time data analysis, the app helps farmers and veterinarians efficiently manage cow health, optimize milk production, and maintain high standards of animal welfare.

### Key Features:
- **Disease Detection and Prevention**: Implements machine learning models for early detection of common cattle diseases. Includes image processing tools for identifying visual symptoms and a comprehensive disease database.
- **Cow Care Management**: User-friendly interface for managing cow profiles, tracking vaccination history, health records, and diet. Includes reminders for important tasks such as vaccinations and vet checkups.
- **Milk Production Prediction**: Predictive model that forecasts milk production based on environmental factors and historical data, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about herd management.
- **Streamlined Veterinary Communication**: Scheduling and communication tools for connecting farmers with veterinarians, including emergency support and an API integration to locate the nearest animal hospitals.
